### 1. Make sure you have what you need

To build this website, you will need to have Node >=6 downloaded and installed on your machine. If you don't already have it, you can get it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">HERE</a>

### 2. Build a Create-React-App

Next, you will build the initial application using a handy tool called Create-React-App. This allows you to get up and running with a React app without the headache of setting up build-tool configurations. Go <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html">HERE</a> to get started. When the app building is finished run `cd yourappname` and run `npm start` to test it out. Hit ctrl+c in the terminal when you want to stop the server that the above command starts. For this project we will also need to install JQuery and ReactGA, do this by running `npm install jquery --save` and `npm install react-ga --save` in your terminal while inside your project folder. YOU MUST RUN THESE COMMANDS.

### 3. Download the template

Once you have a React app up and running by following the steps in the above link, download my code by hitting the green "clone or download" button above and hit download zip. All you will have to do now is replace the "public" and "src" folders of your newly built app with mine that you just downloaded. If you run `npm start` now, you should see that your app renders the same as the one at the live demo link above.

### 4. Enjoy your new Resume Website

When you're all done, run `npm start` again and you'll see your new personal resume website! Congratulations!
